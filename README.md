It is a condition or a situation that makes you feel vague, blurry, clear as mud.
  
When you just run into a problem, it might be easy, it might not. It might be so hard that you want to break your keyboard.  
**BUT** if you go through the adversity, get an insight, and solve the problem, it makes you feel **AWESOME**.  
I name this "OngSongMangSong" because everyone gonna feel it, feel so confused but in the end, everyone gonna solve it.
